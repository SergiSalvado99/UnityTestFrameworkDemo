# UnityTestFrameworkDemo

Unity 3D demo where two test scripts are created and tested using the Unity Test Framework. 

- UnityTest (Play Mode) to check the maximum "y" position that will reach the player when a certain vertical force is applied and compared it with an expected one. 
- Test (Edit Mode) to check that the horizontal force of the player is not 0. 

In the scene called "DemoScene", a gameobject has been created together with a movement script where the Play Mode tests are executed.

Unity Editor: 2021.3.23f1 (LTS)
